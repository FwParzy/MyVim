# MyVim
My custom vim profile

The main vimrc might need some adjusting for mac vs win

To install tmux :
$ Brew install tmux
$ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
Open Tmux and do ctrl-a + I

To Install Vim :
Open Vim and do :PlugInstall
Should be good? idk been a while since i set it up. Will add extra steps for more robust plugins
